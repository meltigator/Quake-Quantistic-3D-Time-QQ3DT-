# Quake-Quantistic-3D-Time-QQ3DT-
A computational experiment on predictive time feedback


This project explores whether a system can achieve increased stability by integrating probabilistic projections of its own future state.
No physical claim about time dimensionality is made; this is a computational and conceptual experiment.
